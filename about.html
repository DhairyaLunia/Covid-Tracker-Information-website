            <h2>Consequences</h2>
            <div class="sub">
                The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human l
                ife worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems

                 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.
